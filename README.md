# echo-app

**echo-app** is a minimal C++ project created as companion code for the [Build Systems](https://dibs.pages.dev) lessons from the *DiseÃ±o e ImplementaciÃ³n de Bibliotecas de Software* course.

This project serves as a practical example to demonstrate:

- How to structure a simple C++ application
- How to configure a build system using CMake
- How to manage build artifacts and development environments with `.gitignore`
- How to evolve a project with tasks, extensions, and custom plugins

## ðŸ›  Build Instructions

To build the project using CMake:

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir -p build
cd build

# Generate project files and build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

This will generate the `echo-app` executable in the `build/` directory.
